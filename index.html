    <p> My name is Zakariya and Im a full-Time Student at We Can {Code} IT. I was born in Kenya and raised in Columbus, Ohio. Growing up I was always a go-getter and a creative person who loved building stuff, I once built a chicken coop so that my chickens wouldnt get eaten by a mongoose. No doubt it was difficult and I felt demoralized from time to time, but a family of supporters were behind me. I have a strong belief that failure is not when you make a mistake but when you stop trying. I started highschool with that mindset and I excelled. Even though I had a setback I managed to finish highschool in two school years. Everything is possible when you have a strong mindset and a supportive family. I embark on this journey of Software Development with this positive mindset and I wish to grow and fulfill my ambitions. 
    <p>I enjoy building websites during my free time.  My creative nature, curiosity, critical thinking skills and determination will help me navigate smoothly through this career. </p>

    <p>This here is a Java console application that allows users to interact with virtual pets in a pet shelter. Users playing the game can feed, water, play and even admit a new pet to the shelter. The skills I used for this project was inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and POJOs. </p>
